Hello! This is my producivity app that includes a journal and a todo list. 

A lot of the documents I referenced were Django documentation.


Here are a couple of things I hope to flesh out eventually:

- Find a way to individually display a message for each day.
        - {% empty %} is not true when ANYTHING is in the list in the for loop. 
        -solution: find a way to either count or know there is no objects of that dotf

- Definetly more style
        -custom images/decor
        -fleshed out
